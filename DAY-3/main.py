# How it works section
with st.expander("üîç How does this work?"):
    st.markdown("""
    **The Three Agents:**
    
    1. **üîç Researcher** - Finds interesting facts about your topic
    2. **‚úçÔ∏è Writer** - Turns those facts into a readable article  
    3. **üìù Editor** - Fixes grammar and makes it perfect
    
    **The Process:**
    - Each agent does their job one after another
    - They pass information to each other
    - The final result is a polished article!
    
    **Why This is Cool:**
    - Each agent has a specific job (like a real team)
    - You can change what each agent does
    - You can add more agents or different tasks
    """)

# Tips section
with st.expander("üí° Tips for Better Results"):
    st.markdown("""
    **For better articles:**
    - Be specific with your topic (e.g., "AI in healthcare" vs "AI")
    - Use topics you're interested in
    - Try different topics to see how agents adapt
    
    **Example topics to try:**
    - "How robots help doctors"
    - "Why space exploration matters"
    - "The future of electric cars"
    - "How social media affects teenagers"
